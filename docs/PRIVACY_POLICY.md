# Privacy Policy (Template)

GOZAR VPN does not collect personal data by default. Configuration is stored locally on-device. No analytics are enabled by default.

If optional crash reporting is enabled, anonymized crash data may be sent to a service you configure. Users will be informed and may opt out.

We do not log user traffic content. Minimal metadata (connection time, status) may be displayed locally and is not transmitted.

Update this document with your final policies prior to store submissions.
